##UI dev build

####Requirements

- [Ruby](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)
- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

####Setup

- From the command line `cd` into the `Content` folder then run `npm install`. This will install all of the required grunt plugins from node's package manager.

####Compiling

- From the command line `cd` into the `Content` folder and run `grunt build`.
- If you are actively working with CSS files you can also run `grunt watch` to compile the CSS each time it's updated.

#####Notes

Any files generated by the compiler should **not** be included in the project or in git as this will cause a lot of confusion in the repository when pulling / pushing.
